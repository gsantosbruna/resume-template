    aboutMe:
      "As an engineering student passionate about programming, I discovered my passion two years after starting my studies in mechanical engineering. I integrated programming during an internship, subsequently evolving into a QA engineer role for two years. Currently pursuing a double degree in mechatronics to gain a fundamental understanding of informatics, I am seeking an end-of-studies internship as a web developer.",
